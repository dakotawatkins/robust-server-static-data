# Robust Server Structure: Static data practice
## Your task is to build an API server for users and states. It should handle the following routes:

-/users returns an array of users in the form { data: Array }
-/users/:userId returns a single user by id in form { data: {} } or User ID not found: ${userId} if the user does not exist.
-/states returns the states data in the form { data: Array }.
-/states/:stateCode returns the states data in the form { data: { stateCode: String, name: String } } or State code not found: ${stateCode} if the state code does not exist.
-Any other path returns: Not found: ${req.originalUrl}

Use the existing data files located in src/data for the responses. Feel free to add or remove data from the files as necessary, but keep the same shape of the data.
